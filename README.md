### Summary
Overall both June and December statistics indicate that the temperatures in Oahu on an average are in the 70s. In the month of december which is a colder month the temperatures can slightly fall below 70F on few days but majority of the time its in 70s. So opening a surf and shake shop in Oahu would be a good idea considering the temperatures in the summer month and the winter month.

Additional analysis:
We also need to look at the precipitation results for the months of June and December to see if the island gets a lot of rain.
Also we can check which stations report more precipitation to find an ideal location for the surf and shake shop.
Also we can query the data to get an average of all the summer months and an average of all the winter months to see if the temperatures are infact idea round the year.
